This is a documentation for those wandering in the DayZ modding and scripting world.

This is supposed to be something quicker to browse and get around with. Hopefully this is useful for modders out there.

It's automatically generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/), using DayZ scripts source code. Also, this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/podrivo/dayz-docs).

This is just the tip of the iceberg, so for more info head to the [Enfusion Modders Discord](https://discord.gg/enfusionmodders).
