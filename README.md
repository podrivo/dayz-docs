Welcome
==

This is sort of a documentation for those wandering in the DayZ modding and scripting world. Supposed to be something quicker to browse and get around with. Hopefully this is useful for modders out there. This is just the tip of the iceberg, so make sure you visit [DayZ Forums](https://forums.dayz.com/), [Community Wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Main_Page), [Enfusion Modders Discord](https://discord.gg/enfusionmodders) and [Grampa's DayZ Academy Discord](https://discord.gg/ZHrYGU6c).

The website is automatically generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/), using DayZ scripts source code. However, you won't find any source code here. For that, make sure you visit [DayZ Script Diff](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Script-Diff/tree/main/scripts).
